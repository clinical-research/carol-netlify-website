          At Carol, we recognize that the healthcare system remains fragmented,
          with siloed solutions offering only incremental improvements. Single
          technologies often fail to address the complexities of modern care,
          leaving clinicians overwhelmed and patients underserved. That’s why we
          embrace Healthcare 4.0 — a holistic approach that unites AI, digital
          twins, blockchain, and real-time data to create an interconnected
          healthcare ecosystem. By empowering hospitals and clinics with these
          innovations, we aim to deliver smarter decisions, streamlined
          operations, and equitable care for all.
