              Our story began with recognizing inefficiencies in modern day care
              delivery, particularly the cognitive burden on physicians
              constantly reorienting to each new patient. Conversations with
              clinic owners and observations in high-stress settings like the ER
              revealed how fragmented, static data slows care and limits
              meaningful engagement. This led us to focus on clinician
              primingâ€”providing timely, context-rich information to improve
              decision-making for both clinicians and teams. Looking ahead, we
              aim to leverage world models to capture and predict the evolving
              medical environment, enabling real-time, proactive care. Our
              vision spans global health systems and includes expanding access
              in remote settings through edge-based solutions, building a more
              connected, efficient, private, and equitable future for
              healthcare.
